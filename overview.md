# Overview

## The Endgame Plan

The Endgame Plan is a proposal to overhaul and improve the governance and tokenomics of the Maker Ecosystem. Its primary aim is for the ecosystem to reach a self-sustainable equilibrium called the Endgame State. In this state, the ecosystem is resilient, and the scope and complexity of Maker Core will no longer change.

The Endgame Plan was [introduced](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/decentralized-voter-committee-on-tuesday-5pm-cest-all-mkr-holders-welcome/15166) by Rune Christensen, the co-founder of Maker. After a series of initial discussions, Maker Governance accepted the [MIP set](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmTmS5Nf) ratifying this plan on 24 October 2022. 

The Endgame Plan remains in active development, led by Rune Christensen. The latest complete and published description of the Endgame Plan is available [here](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/endgame-plan-v3-complete-overview/17427). Note that some parts are now out of date.  


This documentation describes planned functionality and processes that MakerDAO has not yet implemented. Be aware that parts may be inaccurate or out of date.

## Goals

The Endgame Plan has many goals which come together to create the Endgame State. A list of these goals is below:
- Ensure that Maker Core is more resilient to external risks such as regulatory action.
- Ensure that the Maker Ecosystem can scale in a decentralized manner.
- Create positive community culture and engagement, known as good "meta", and design processes that promote and preserve good meta.
- Realign incentives for various parties in the Maker Ecosystem.
- Reduce governance overhead for MKR holders and Maker delegates.
- Cut scope creep in Maker Core.
- Reduce MKR concentration through revised tokenomics and MKR emissions.

## Core Elements

The Endgame Plan consists of the following main components:

### [SubDAOs](subdaos/overview.md)

The Endgame Plan is based on reorganizing the existing decentralized workforce ecosystem into new self-sustainable DAOs called SubDAOs. Since each SubDAO is a DAO, it will have its own unique governance token, governance processes, workforce, and interfaces.

SubDAOs are expected to maintain a synergistic relationship with Maker Core through appropriate alignment of incentive structures.

Moving much of the developmental, operational, and governance work to SubDAOs makes Maker Core simpler and more resilient.

### [Scopes and Scope Frameworks](maker-core/scopes-and-frameworks.md)

Maker Core will consist of twelve Scopes. A Scope is a broad focus area for any work done to operate or improve the protocol. 

The goal of introducing Scopes is to limit scope creep and ensure that any work done aligns with Maker Core's goals.

Scope Frameworks define the rules that SubDAOs must adhere to. Scope Frameworks will be refined over time to maximize profit and minimize risk to Maker Core.

Scope Frameworks limit the governance overhead by ensuring that Maker Core only focuses on high-level decisions. They also encourage innovation among SubDAOs without allowing them to take excessive risks that may damage Maker Core. 

### [Decentalized Voter Committees](maker-core/dvc.md)

Decentralized Voter Committees (DVCs) are a group of voters with aligned values and views. DVCs engage in the important high-level questions of Maker Governance.

The objective of DVCs is to ensure that they represent MKR voters that are aligned with the values of that DVC. Members of DVCs will be compensated for their engagement under certain conditions, thereby incentivizing active governance. 

### [Tokenomics](tokenomics/launch-tokenomics.md)

The Endgame Plan introduces [Elixir](tokenomics/elixir.md) and [SubElixir](tokenomics/subelixir.md), which are liquidity pool tokens representing liquidity pools holding various combinations of MKR, ETH, DAI and SubDAO governance tokens. The aim of these tokens is twofold. First, it ensures alignment of interests between Maker Core and SubDAOs. Second, it also improves liquidity for all these tokens on the open market. 

The Endgame Plan has two major tokenomics updates. First, annual MKR minting will be used to incubate SubDAOs, fund DVCs, and incentivize the workforce. These emissions counteract the MKR burn and reduce the likelihood of MKR becoming concentrated in the hands of large holders.

ETH and staked ETH will play a major role in ensuring the financial resilience of Maker Core. [EtherDAI](tokenomics/etherdai.md) is a synthetic Ether token backed by liquid staked Ether tokens and Maker-issued debt. EtherDAI is one of the central products of the Endgame Plan. 

In the final stages of Endgame, DAI will turn into an Unbiased World Currency. In particular, it is not expected to remain pegged to the US Dollar and will instead have alternative mechanisms that determine its Target Price. 

MKR tokens will no longer function as a backstop in the event that Maker is insolvent - instead, this will be reflected in the Target Price of DAI.
