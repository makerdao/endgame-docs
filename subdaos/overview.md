# SubDAOs

SubDAOs are semi-independent, specialized DAOs that are formed by MakerDAO and designed for protocol alignment. There are different types of subDAOs, and each type has a different role.

## Overview

SubDAOs have each their own unique governance token, governance processes, and workforce. They are driven by a self-determined, self-aware *meta* (understood as the non-quantifiable values, aspirations, and sensibilities within a human-operated organization - its ethos). 

In most respects subDAOs are self-standing, unique DAOs. Their semi-independent nature helps segregate complexity from Maker Core, alleviate the cognitive load of governance, and derisk MakerDAO by sandboxing the effects of subDAO operations. However, subDAO governance processes run on top of MakerCore governance infrastructure and MKR holders retain control of many of the subDAOs assets.

## SubDAO Types

SubDAOs are divided into two types:

- **[Facilitator subDAOs](facilitator.md)**: Facilitate governance for other subDAOs, for scope frameworks, and for arbitration.
- **[Protector subDAOs](protector.md)**: Protect real-world collateral loans. They house RWA products and take on a first-loss position on all non-decentralized lending.
- **[Creator subDAOs](creator.md)**: Further decentralized collateral revenue streams. They focus on revenue and product generation.
