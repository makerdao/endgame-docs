# Creator SubDAOs

Creator subDAOs focus on innovation, experimentation, and growth &mdash; both with regards to technology and also branding and meta development. They are the most open-ended of subDAO classes.

## Decentralized Vault Adoption

Creator subDAOs can adopt existing or new vault types on the Maker Protocol Vault Engine. The choice of vault to adopt is made by the subDAO itself via its internal governance processes. However, the adoption must be ratified by Maker Governance through a MIP that sets a Debt Ceiling for the adopted vault and its capital cost &mdash;i.e., the minimum expected return&mdash;, which in turn defines how much of the Stability Fee for the adopted vault must go to Maker Core.

Adopted vaults impose a first-loss position for the adopting creator subDAO on all downsides.
