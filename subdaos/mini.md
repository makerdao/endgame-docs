# MiniDAOs

MiniDAOs are one of the three types of [SubDAOs](overview.md) in the Maker Ecosystem along with [AllocatorDAOs](allocator.md) and [FacilitatorDAOs](facilitator.md).

## Overview

Unlike the other SubDAO types, MiniDAOs are experimental SubDAOs that do not have any specific mission other than furthering the growth of the Maker Protocol. They are spun off by [AllocatorDAOs](allocator.md) in their exploration of innovative concepts and products. As such, MiniDAOs are expected to display the greatest diversity among SubDAO types. Their experimental nature may also make them likely to be short-lived if they fail to meet adequate product-market fit.

MiniDAOs are by design easy for AllocatorDAOs to spin off.
