# Constitutional Delegates (CDs)

Constitutional Delegates (CDs) are [delegates](https://manual.makerdao.com/delegation/overview/what-is-delegation) who are also [Constitutional Conservers](https://endgame.makerdao.com/maker-core/tbc-governance/constitutional-conservers). MKR holders can delegate their MKR to Constitutional Delegates through the [Easy Governance Frontend (EGF)](easy-governance-frontend.md).

## Overview

Unlike ordinary delegates, CDs are eligible for compensation and are subject to certain restrictions. In particular, CDs must execute governance strategies defined by [Constitutional Voter Committees](cvc.md).

CDs do not take part in the creation of CVC strategies, they only execute them. This helps to mitigate the risk of a delegate's misalignment with MKR holders.  

In addition to voting, CDs must aim to support CVCs by providing governance information and research material.  

CDs must not engage with other ecosystem actors or in operational activities. They are not allowed to compensate MKR holders that delegate to them.  

## Income
CDs can receive compensation from the Maker Protocol. The compensation goes to the top 14 CDs that have the highest amount of total MKR delegated to their delegate contracts and fulfill the CD eligibility requirements.

There are two income levels for the top 14 eligible CDs: Prime and Reserve. The 7 top eligible CDs are called the Prime Constitutional Delegates (PCDs). The top 8 to 14 eligible CDs are called the Reserve Constitutional Delegates (RCDs).

Each income level has a monthly total compensation, which is divided between delegates qualifying for that level. The PCD total compensation is higher than the RCD total compensation.

### Eligibility Requirements
To become eligible for a share of the PCD or RCD compensation, CDs must fulfill the following requirements:
1) Participation in CVC Subcommittee Meetings (monthly)
    - PCDs must participate in 16+
    - RCDs must participate in 4+
2) Voting Activity (yearly)
    - CDs must be active in 95%+ of all votes
3) Communication Activity (yearly)
    - CDs must communicate reasoning for their voting in 95%+ of all votes

Participation in subcommittee Meetings is a hard requirement, and failing to meet it makes a Constitutional Delegate ineligible for compensation.

Compensation is reduced with lower voting and communication activity, reaching zero at 75% activity for either requirement. If activity falls below 75%, the Constitutional Delegate no longer qualifies as a PCD or RCD, and other Constitutional Delegates are shifted up into those slots if they themselves are eligible.

## Visibility

Constitutional Delegates are displayed prominently in the EGF as followers of a CVC's Strategy. When they receive delegated vote weight through a CVCs Governance Strategy, they must vote according to that strategy.
