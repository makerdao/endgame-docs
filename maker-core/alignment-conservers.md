## Types

There are two types of Constitutional Conserver, a [CVC](avc.md) Member and a [Constitutional Delegate](delegates.md).

The Arbitration Scope gives recognition to each type of Constitutional Conserver if they meet the requirements. Ecosystem Actors that become recognized as a type of Constitutional Conserver may not assume any other ecosystem role, including that of a different type of Constitutional Conserver.

## Purpose

The Maker Constitution is designed to safeguard the interests of MKR holders. By preserving and protecting the Constitution from changes, Constitutional Conservers function as guardians of MKR holders' interests.

Constitutional Conservers may never change the Constitution or governance dynamics unless they do it within the Constitution processes and frameworks. During Pregame, CVC Members are allowed and encouraged to help refine the Maker Constitution.

## Eligibility requirements
To be eligible, Constitutional Conservers must make a public pledge committing to:
- Preserve the Constitution
- Oppose and publicly expose all forms of corruption, organizational drifts, and other threats to the Constitution

Constitutional Conservers must be anonymous. During Pregame, anonymity is encouraged but not required.

A Constitutional Conserver can be **derecognized** if it acts against the pledge or against any of the requirements attached to their type.

If the breach is *mild*, the Constitutional Conserver receives a warning, which is recorded by the Arbitration Scope Framework. There are no further consequences for *first-time* breaches.

If the breach is *severe*, the Constitutional Conserver is derecognized and no longer receives the privileges attached to the Constitutional Conserver role.
