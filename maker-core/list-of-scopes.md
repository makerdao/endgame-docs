# List of Scopes

The Endgame Scopes are divided into two categories, primary and supporting. Further, some scopes are Exclusive or Mandatory and these are denoted by **(E)** and **(M)** respectively. More details on the categorizations and tagging are provided in the [Scopes and Frameworks page](scopes-and-frameworks.md).

This documentation describes planned functionality and processes that MakerDAO has not yet implemented. Be aware that parts may be inaccurate or out of date.


## Primary Scopes
The following scopes are the primary scopes of the Endgame Constitution.
1. **Protocol Engineering:** This scope covers all aspects of upgrading and maintaining the Maker Core protocol. It includes research, development, and deployment of protocol-level products, features, and upgrades. It also includes security-related work such as continuous audits of smart contracts, security research, and bug bounty programs.
2. **Decentralized Collateral (E):** This scope covers the onboarding, management and offboarding of all decentralized collateral. This includes parameter adjustments, prioritization of new collateral types, onboarding work for new collateral types, vault adoption, and D3M connections to Creator SubDAOs. 
3. **RWA Collateral (E):** This scope covers the onboarding, management and offboarding of Real World Assets collateral. It also covers onboarding of new [Peg Stability Mechanisms](../concepts/peg-stability-mechanisms.md). It includes parameter adjustments, prioritization of new collateral types, onboarding work for new collateral types, vault adoption, and D3M connections to Protector SubDAOs. 
4. **Growth:** This scope focuses on developing the Maker and DAI brand. It allocates budget to fund various growth and marketing initiatives. It is also responsible for maintaining the official MakerDAO and SubDAO websites, frontend designs, and branding.
 
## Supporting Scopes
The following scopes are the supporting scopes of the Endgame Constitution.
1. **Finance (E):** This scope covers the financial reporting processes and systems for the protocol. It also provides regular comprehensive updates and overviews of the state of the protocol's finances.
2. **Stability and Liquidity (E):** This scope handles management of a cashlike RWA portfolio. It is also responsible for management of the Protocol Owned Vault. When DAI is no longer pegged to 1 USD, this scope determines target inflation rates for DAI.
3. **Physical Resilience:** This scope identifies and mitigates legal, legislative and regulatory threats to the protocol.
4. **Interface (E):** This scope focuses on regulation and development of the core elements of the decentralized frontend for the Maker community. It is responsible for a fully functional and secure decentralized frontend codebase is available for the workforce and users to interface with the Maker Protocol.
5. **Infrastructure:** This scope handles the security requirements of the most critical infrastructure of the Maker Protocol. This includes oracles, keepers and other core infrastructure.
6. **Ecosystem (E):** This scope handles governance processes of Maker Core. It also covers governance communications and management of community platforms. It is also responsible for SubDAO monitoring and initial dispute resolution for SubDAOs.
7. **Governance Security (M):** This scope ensures that the protocol is secure from governance attacks. This includes ensuring that there is enough MKR on the hat, monitoring how easily MKR can be borrowed from lending platforms, reviewing emergency shutdown parameters, etc.
8. **Arbitration (M):** This scope handles providing final arbitration on governance disputes involving SubDAOs, delegates, and Decentralized Voter Committees (DVCs).
