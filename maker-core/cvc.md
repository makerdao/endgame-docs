# Constitutional Voter Committees (CVCs)

## Overview

Aligned Voter Committees (AVCs) are organized groups of MKR holders who have a shared vision. They form opinions on the direction of Maker Governance by producing and updating Position Documents.  

Each AVC produces Aligned Governance Strategy documents and Aligned Scope Proposals to update the [Scope Artifacts](https://endgame.makerdao.com/maker-core/list-of-scopes). This set of documents provide general guidelines for how Aligned Delegates (ADs) that follow their governance strategy should vote.

AVCs are one type of Voter Committee. AVCs must have at least one member who is an [Alignment Conserver (AC)](https://endgame.makerdao.com/maker-core/tbc-governance/constitutional-conservers) and a verified MKR holder. They are subject to eligibility requirements.

## Purpose

AVCs exist to represent the interest of MKR holders. They are responsible to creating documentation to inform Maker holders and align governance with the focus areas of the Maker Protocol. Delegates must follow these strategies.
Position Documents abstract away the minutiae of day-to-day governance. They allow MKR Holders to be reasonably informed and secure with regards to the general direction of their chosen delegation.

## Eligibility Requirements

Voter Committees must meet certain requirements for at least a quarterly governance cycle to become AVCs:
- At least one registered member must be an AC and a verified MKR holder
- On each quarterly governance cycle, AVCs must:
 - Create one Aligned Governance Strategy document and five Aligned Scope Proposals
 - Hold two AVC Subcommittee meetings for each scope

The [Governance Scope](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113) gives this recognition. It can revoke it anytime the AVC fails to meet all eligibility requirements.

## Member Participation Rewards

The Member Participation Rewards is a compensation available to AVC members. It considers their participation in each scope.
To be eligible, AVC members must:
 - Attend the AVC Subcommittee Meetings
 - Co-author the AVC Aligned Governance Strategy document and the Aligned Scope Proposals
AVC members who fulfill these eligibility requirements and have the highest verified MKR ownership get the slots.


## Visibility
The [EGF](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP110#sentence-summary) displays AVCs on a list that ranks them by their voter weight. The AVC with the highest voter weight being on top of it. The voter weight is calculated by adding the verified MKR holdings of members plus the MKR delegated to delegates that follow the AVC's Governance Strategy.

### Aligned Delegate interaction AVC Governance Strategies
ADs can display themselves in the EGF as followers of a AVC's Strategy. When they receive votes delegated through a Governance Strategy, they must execute it.
Through an AVC decision, AVCs can ban ADs from being displayed as followers of their strategy. If this happens, the votes delegated through a AVC's Strategy will count towards the AD's independent strategy.
