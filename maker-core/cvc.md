# Constitutional Voter Committees (CVCs)

Constitutional Voter Committees (CVCs) are organized groups of MKR holders who have a shared vision for the protocol. They produce and publish documentation communicating their vision and strategy which is used by Constitutional Delegates to direct the evolution of the Maker Protocol.

## Overview

Each CVC produces Governance Strategy Position documents and Scope Framework Position Documents to update the [Scope Frameworks](list-of-scopes.md). This set of documents provides general guidelines for how [Constitutional Delegates (CDs)](delegates.md) that follow their governance strategy should vote.

Position Documents abstract away the minutiae of day-to-day governance. Since Constitutional Delegates execute CVC strategies, they allow MKR Holders to be reasonably informed and secure with regard to the general direction of the chosen delegate.

In order for a Voter Committee to be considered a CVC, it must have at least one member who is a [Constitutional Conserver (CC)](constitutional-conservers.md) and a verified MKR holder. CVCs are also subject to additional eligibility requirements, detailed below.

## Eligibility Requirements

Voter Committees must meet certain requirements for at least a quarterly governance cycle to become CVCs:
- At least one registered member must be a CC and a verified MKR holder
- For each quarterly governance cycle, CVCs must:
   1. Create a Governance Strategy Position and 12 Scope Framework Position documents
   2. Hold one CVC Subcommittee meeting for each scope

The [Arbitration Scope](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113) recognizes eligible CVCs. It can revoke this recognition anytime the CVC fails to meet all eligibility requirements.

## Member Participation Rewards

Member Participation Rewards is a compensation scheme available to CVC members. It considers their participation in each scope.
To be eligible, CVC members must:
 - Attend the CVC Subcommittee Meetings
 - Co-author the CVC Governance Strategy Position Document
CVC Members who fulfill these eligibility requirements and have the highest verified MKR ownership are eligible for compensation.


## Visibility
The [Easy Governance Frontend (EGF)](easy-governance-frontend.md) displays CVCs on a list that ranks them by their voter weight. The voter weight is calculated by adding the verified MKR holdings of members plus the MKR delegated to delegates that follow the CVC's Governance Strategy.
