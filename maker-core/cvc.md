# Constitutional Voter Committees (CVCs)

## Overview

Constitutional Voter Committees (CVCs) are organized groups of MKR holders who have a shared vision . They form opinions on the direction of Maker Governance by producing and updating Position Documents.  

Each CVC produces Governance Strategy Position documents and Scope Framework Position Documents to update the [Scope Frameworks](https://endgame.makerdao.com/maker-core/list-of-scopes). This set of documents provide general guidelines for how CDs that follow their governance strategy should vote.

CVCs are one type of Voter Committee. CVCs must have at least one member who is a [Constitutional Conserver (CC)](https://endgame.makerdao.com/maker-core/tbc-governance/constitutional-conservers) and a verified MKR holder. They are subject to eligibility requirements.

## Purpose

CVCs exist to represent the interest of MKR holders. They are responsible to creating documentation to inform Maker holders and align governance with the focus areas of the Maker Protocol. Delegates must follow these strategies.
Position Documents abstract away the minutiae of day-to-day governance. They allow MKR Holders to be reasonably informed and secure with regards to the general direction of their chosen delegation.

## Eligibility Requirements

Voter Committees must meet certain requirements for at least a quarterly governance cycle to become CVCs:
- At least one registered member must be a CC and a verified MKR holder
- On each quarterly governance cycle, CVCs must:
 - Create a Governance Strategy Position and 12 Scope Framework Position documents
 - Hold one CVC Subcommittee meeting for each scope

The [Arbitration Scope](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113) gives this recognition. It can revoke it anytime the CVC fails to meet all eligibility requirements.

## Member Participation Rewards

The Member Participation Rewards is a compensation available to CVC members. It considers their participation in each scope.
To be eligible, CVC members must:
 - Attend the CVC Subcommittee Meetings
 - Co-author the CVC Governance Strategy Position Document
CVC Members who fulfill these eligibility requirements and have the highest verified MKR ownership get the slots.


## Visibility
The [EGF](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP110#sentence-summary) displays CVCs on a list that ranks them by their voter weight. The CVC with the highest voter weight being on top of it. The voter weight is calculated by adding the verified MKR holdings of Members plus the MKR delegated to delegates that follow the CVC's Governance Strategy.

### Constitutional Delegate (CD) interaction CVC Governance Strategies
CDs can display themselves in the EGF as followers of a CVC's Strategy. When they receive votes delegated through a Governance Strategy, they must execute it.
Through a CVC decision, CVCs can ban CDs from being displayed as followers of their strategy. If this happens, the votes delegated through a CVC's Strategy will count towards the CD's independent strategy.
