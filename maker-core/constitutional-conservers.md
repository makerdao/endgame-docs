# Constitutional Conservers

## Overview
Constitutional Conservers (CC) are the guardians of the [Maker Constitution](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101). They must preserve the Constitution and fight against any threats to it.

CC may never change the Constitution or governance dynamics, unless they do it within the Constitution processes and frameworks. Only during Pregame, CVC Members are allowed and encouraged to help refine the Maker Constitution.

There are many types of CCs. The Arbitration Scope gives recognition to each type of CC. CC may not assume multiple CC types simultaneously or any other ecosystem role. During Pregame, CC can be a [CVC](cvc.md) Member or a [Constitutional Delegate](delegates.md).


## Purpose

The Constitution intends to represent MKR holders interests and safeguard them. CCs pledge to the Constitution and their role in it. They function as guardians of MKR holders' interests. They have the responsibility to follow the Constitution and to denounce any breach to it.


## Eligibility requirements
To be eligible, CC must make a public pledge committing to:
- Preserve the Constitution
- Fight against and publicly expose all forms of corruption, organizational drifts, and other threats to the Constitution

CC must be anonymous. During Pregame, anonymity is encouraged but not required.

The CC status is **derecognized** when a CC acts against their pledge or against any of the requirements attached to their type. Failing to meet these requirements is also considered a breach to their pledge.

When the breach is *mild*, CCs receive a warning, which is recorded by the Arbitration Scope Framework. There are no further consequences for *first-time* breaches. The CC does not lose their status.
When the breach is *severe*, CC are derecognized and lose all *reputation* in the Ecosystem Scope Framework and the Physical Resilience Scope Framework.
