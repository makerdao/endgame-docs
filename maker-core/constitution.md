# Constitution

The Endgame Plan includes a Constitution. The Maker Constitution defines key elements of the endgame plan and must be adhered to by actors in the MakerDAO ecosystem. The goal of the constitution is to ensure the success and resilience of the Maker Protocol over the long term.

In its initial state, the Maker Constitution is unfinished, and will be worked on and improved over the Pregame Phase.
