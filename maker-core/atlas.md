# Constitution

The Endgame Plan includes a Constitution. The Maker Constitution defines key elements of the endgame plan. Actors in the MakerDAO ecosystem must adhere to its contents. The goal of the Maker Constitution is to ensure the success and resilience of the Maker Protocol over the long term.

The Maker Constitution is currently unfinished and will be improved over the Pregame Phase.
