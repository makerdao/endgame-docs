# Atlas Immutable Alignment Artifact

The Atlas Immutable Alignment Artifact (Atlas) is the foundational set of rules that govern MakerDAO. It provides a high-level description of the DAO, its actors, incentives, and work areas. Together with the Scope Bounded Mutable Alignment Artifacts (Scope Artifacts), the Atlas defines the operational framework of the DAO.

The Atlas is currently unfinished but active. Once the Endgame State is reached, the Atlas will become immutable.

## Structure

The Atlas comprises seven broad thematic sections further broken down into articles. The list below contains a very brief summary of the contents of each section.

**[0: Definitions](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#0-definitions)**  
Lists the main terms used within the Atlas and across the Scope Artifacts.

**[1: The Atlas](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#1-the-atlas)**  
Will contain the Atlas Preamble in the near future.

**[2: The Governance Scope](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-the-governance-scope-gov)**  
Defines the overall rules for the Governance Scope, further defined under [MIP113: Governance Scope Bounded Mutable Alignment Artifact](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113).

**[3: The Support Scope](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#3-the-support-scope)**  
Defines the overall rules for the Support Scope, further defined under [MIP106: Support Scope Bounded Mutable Alignment Artifact](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP106).

**[4: The Protocol Scope](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#4-the-protocol-scope)**  
Defines the overall rules for the Protocol Scope, further defined under [MIP107: Protocol Scope Bounded Mutable Alignment Artifact](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP107).

**[5: The Stability Scope](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#6-constitutional-delegates-cds-)**  
Defines the overall rules for the Stability Scope, further defined under [MIP104: Stability Scope Bounded Mutable Alignment Artifact](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP104).

**[6: The Accessibility Scope](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#6-the-accessibility-scope)**  
Defines the overall rules for the Accessibility Scope, further defined under [MIP106: Support Scope Bounded Mutable Alignment Artifact](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP106).

## Interactions

The Atlas represents the ultimate authority for governing the DAO and overrules all other Alignment Artifacts. It contains strict principles for the interpretation of its contents. All actors within the MakerDAO ecosystem must adhere to the contents of the Atlas.

Alignment Conservers (i.e., Aligned Voter Committee Members, Aligned Delegates, Facilitators, and Budget Allocators) commit to maintaining and protecting the Atlas against corruption.

Each Scope Artifact must adhere to the Scope Boundaries defined in the Atlas.
