# Scopes and Scope Artifacts

{% hint style="warning" %} This documentation describes ongoing changes in functionality and processes. Be aware that parts may be inaccurate or out of date. {% endhint %}

## Overview
A Scope is a broad area of focus for products, protocol-related work, and/or governance in MakerDAO. All work done within the Maker Ecosystem must fall under one of the five Scopes.

Every Scope has a Scope Bounded Mutable Aligment Artifact. These are frameworks that contain the rules for all work, governance, and other processes that take place under that Scope. Scope Artifacts can be amended through [MIP102c2 subproposals](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP102#MIP102c2).

## Modification of Scope Artifact
Scope Artifacts are modifiable within the constraints of Scope Boundaries that are immutably defined in the Maker Atlas. An ossification rule is also applied to elements of Scope Artifacts - broadly speaking, an element of a Scope Artifact cannot undergo large changes if it has been unchanged for a relatively long period of time. There exist soft clauses that are not required to follow the ossification rule.

Any change made to a Scope Artifact must aim to improve one or more of the following desirable features of the Maker Ecosystem.
- Decentralization
- Autonomous operation
- Future-proofing
- Resilience
- Clarity of instructions
- Simplicity of protocol

## Governance
Each Scope has a Scope Advisory Council. This Council consists of members who must fulfill certain requirements and have been approved by Maker Governance. The Council carries out advisory work related to improving the content of the Scope Artifacts.

## Example Scopes
The Stability Scope covers the rules related to managing the core stablecoin product, Dai, and supporting factors related to financial stability, such as surplus buffer and decentralized asset reserve.

The Accessibility Scope covers accessibility and distribution efforts, and regulates user-facing frontends of MakerDAO Core and SubDAOs. Operational rules are defined in the Accessibility Scope Artifact.
